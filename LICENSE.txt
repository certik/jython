3. In the event Licensee, at its sole cost and expense, uses the
Software to prepare a derivative work that is based on or
incorporates the Software or any part thereof, and wants to
make the derivative work available to the public for
commercial or noncommercial purposes, or uses the software
in this derivative form to provide a service to the public, then
Licensee hereby agrees: (i) to indicate in any such work, in a
prominently visible way, the specific modifications made to
CNRI's Software; (ii) not to introduce deliberately any
modifications where there is reason to believe they will be
harmful to other users and their systems; and (iii) to notify

any claims under copyright, patent or other rights or interests
and that CNRI may reproduce, disseminate and otherwise use
the changes as part of the Software at no cost to CNRI or its
licensed users, and to authorize others to do so. CNRI may, at
its sole discretion, decide whether or not to incorporate any
such changes in the Software.

6. In the installation, running or other permitted use of the

licensed and Licensee complies with the terms and conditions
of any license agreements accompanying such programs.

a party to or otherwise subject to any obligations of Licensee
to third parties. CNRI does not represent that the Software will
operate in an uninterrupted manner or in combination with
other computer programs.

7. Licensee may not use CNRI's trademarks or trade name,
including JPython or CNRI, in a
trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services of

DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY THEREOF. SOME STATES DO NOT
ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF
LIABILITY SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER MAY NOT

immediately upon written notice from CNRI of any material
breach by the Licensee, if the nature of the breach is such that
it cannot be promptly remedied; or (ii) sixty (60) days
