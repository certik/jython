<h3>The JPython FAQ</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>What is JPython?</b>

    <p>JPython is a new implementation of the Python programming
    language which is designed to run on the Java(tm) Platform.  It
    consists of a compiler to compile Python source code down to Java
    bytecodes which can run directly on a JVM, a set of support
    libraries which are used by the compiled Java bytecodes, and extra
    support to make it trivial to use Java packages from within
    JPython.

<p><li><b>Is JPython the same language as Python?</b>
    <P>We will always strive to ensure that JPython remains as
    compatible with CPython as possible.  Nevertheless, there are a
    number of differences between the two implementations that are
    unlikely to go away.  These range from the trival - JPython's code
    objects don't have a co_code attribute because they don't have any
    Python bytecodes; to the significant - JPython uses Java's true
    garbage collection rather than Python's reference counting
    scheme.

    <P>Python has never really had much of a language definition
    beyond it's C-based implementation.  The existence of
    JPython changed that for the first time and will hopefully lead to
    a much clearer sense of what Python the language is; independent
    of any specific implementation.

    <P>We will be preparing a
    version of Python's regression test that would be appropriate for
    new implementations of the language.  This is a good first step
    towards defining what parts of Python are essential and which are
    incidental.

<p><li><b>What is the current status of JPython?</b>
    <p>As of this writing (17-Jun-1999) JPython 1.1beta2 has been
    released.  Jim Hugunin, JPython's author, has moved out to sunny
    California to work on Xerox PARC's
    <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/spl/projects/aop/">AspectJ</a>
    language.  JPython continues to be maintained by Barry Warsaw at
    CNRI, with help and input from Python's author Guido van Rossum,
    other CNRI folks, and the many contributors on the
    <a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/jpython-interest">
    JPython-Interest</a> mailing list.

<p><li><b><A NAME="Supported Modules"></A>What parts of the Python
    library are supported?</b>

    <P>The good news is that JPython now supports the large majority
    of the standard Python library.  The bad news is that this has
    moved so rapidly, it's hard to keep the documentation up to
    date.

    <p>Built-in modules (e.g. those that are written in C for CPython) 
    are a differnet story.  These would have to be ported to Java, or
    implemented with a JNI bridge in order to be used by JPython.
    Some built-in modules have been ported to JPython, most notably
    cStringIO, cPickle, struct, and binascii (donated by Finn Bock).
    It is unlikely that JNI modules will be included in JPython proper 
    though.</P>

    <P>If you want to use a standard Python module, just try importing
    it.  If it that works you're probably all set.  You can also do a
    dir() on the modules to check the list of functions it
    implements.</P>

    <P>If there is some standard Python module that you have a real
    need for that doesn't work with JPython yet, please
    <a href="mailto:jpython@python.org">send us mail</a>.

<p><li><b>How fast is JPython?</b>

    <P>At IPC-6 JimH reported speeds equal to CPython 1.4 on the
    pystone benchmark.  The current release doesn't include two of the
    optimizations that he used in his own version of the system so it
    will be about 15% slower than CPython 1.4.  These optimizations
    may be added back into the distribution when there's been time to
    test them more carefully.  When JimH ran his tests, CPython 1.5
    had just been released, which Guido succeeded in making about 2x
    faster than the 1.4 release.  Therefore, JPython is currently
    about 2.5x slower than CPython 1.5.  <b>The benchmark tests have
    not be re-run since CPython 1.5.2 or JPython 1.1beta2 were
    released.  I'll be updating the results before the JPython 1.1
    final release is made.</b></P>

    <P>The speed of JPython is tied very tightly to the speed of the
    underlying JVM.  The benchmark results that JimH reported were all
    using Microsoft's JVM from Internet Explorer 4.0.  The next
    fastest JVM that he used is almost a factor of 2 slower than this.
    At some point I'll want to collect a set of scores comparing
    PyStone performance on a wider variety of JVM's.</P>

    <P>Finally, pystone is not the last word in benchmarking.  At the
    moment I'm much more concerned with making JPython complete and
    correct than with performance.  We will continually be revisiting
    performance issues both to examine better benchmark's for
    comparing JPython and CPython (as well as other scripting
    languages for the JVM) and work at optimizing JPython's
    performance.

<p><li><b>Why did I get an OutOfMemoryError?</b>

    <P>If you are using SUN's Java VM (or a derived VM) the virtual
    machine sets a default memory limit of 16 MB.  This can be very
    confusing when you are running on a machine with 128 MB of RAM and
    you see an OutOfMemoryError after having used only 17 MB.</P>

    <P>You can increase this memory limit by adding the following
    switch to the call that invokes the Java VM (you need to modify
    the jpython launch script):</P>

<pre>
    <B>jre -mx32m &lt;...&gt;</B>
</pre>

    <P>This will set your upper memory limit to 32 MB.  Obviously,
    higher limits should be used if required by your program - and
    supported by your computer..

<p><li><b>Semantic Differences between JPython and CPython</b>

    <P>There are several several differences between JPython and
    CPython that wil probably never go away.  These differences are
    primarily related to underlying differences between the C and Java
    programming languages/environments.  See <a
    href="differences.html">a more detailed list</a> of these
    differences.  In brief though, here are two of the more obvious
    differences you'll notice:

    <p><UL>
	<LI><em>JPython has true garbage collection - CPython uses
	reference counting.</em>

	<br>This means that in JPython users don't need to worry about
	    creating circular references as these are guarnteed to be
	    collected properly.  On the other hand, users of JPython have
	    no guarantees of when an object will be finalized (short of
	    calling System.gc() to force garbage collection).
	    Theoretically, this might cause problems for users who were
	    depending on CPython's finalization timing to free limited
	    system resources.  Also, because of the severe performance 
	    hit when providing non-trivial Java <tt>finalize()</tt>
	    methods, no Python object's <tt>__del__()</tt> method is
	    ever called.

	<p><LI><em>Control-C can not be caught by JPython, but will exit the
	    shell completely</em>
    </UL>

<p><li><b>JPython and Y2K</b>

    <p>The standard response to queries about JPython's Y2K compliance 
    points you to the
    <a href="http://grail.cnri.reston.va.us/cgi-bin/faqw.py?querytype=anykeywords&casefold=yes&req=search&query=y2k">
    Python FAQ entry on the subject</a>, with the additional caveat
    that JPython is of course dependent on any Y2K issues associated
    with the underlying JVM and Java class libraries you're using.
    However, you can essentially apply the Python Y2K stance to
    JPython by, e.g. substituting the word "Java" for "C" in FAQ
    question 4.65 (<em>ignore the clip from the Python copyright
    notice).
