<h3>The JPython FAQ</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>What is JPython?</b>

    <p>JPython is a new implementation of the Python programming
    language which is designed to run on SUN's Java(tm) Platform.  It
    consists of a compiler to compile Python source code down to Java
    bytecodes which can run directly on a JVM, a set of support
    libraries which are used by the compiled Java bytecodes, and extra
    support to make it trivial to use Java packages from within
    JPython.

<p><li><b>Is JPython the same language as Python?</b>
    <P>I'm eager to ensure that JPython remains as compatible with
    CPython (the current implementation) as possible.  Nevertheless,
    there are a number of differences between the two implementations
    that are unlikely to go away.  These range from the trival -
    JPython's code objects don't have a co_code attribute because they
    don't have any Python bytecodes; to the significant - JPython uses
    Java's true garbage collection rather than Python's reference
    counting scheme.</P>

    <P>Python has never really had much of a language definition
    beyond it's current C-based implementation.  The existence of
    JPython changes that for the first time and will hopefully lead to
    a much clearer sense of what Python the language is; independent
    of any specific implementation.  Stay tuned for more
    details...</P>

    <P>I've started working (with Guido's input) on preparing a
    version of Python's regression test that would be appropriate for
    new implementations of the language.  This is a good first step
    towards defining what parts of Python are essential and which are
    incidental.

<p><li><b><A NAME="Supported Modules"></A>What parts of the Python
    library are supported?</b>

    <P>The good news is that the 1.0 beta 1 release of JPython
    supports the large majority of the standard Python library.  The
    bad news is that this has moved so rapidly I've been unable to
    keep up with the documentation.</P>

    <P>If you want to use a standard Python module, just try importing
    it.  If it that works you're probably all set.  You can also do a
    dir on the modules to check the list of functions it
    implements.</P>

    <P>If there is some standard Python module that you have a real
    need for that doesn't work with JPython yet, please send me mail
    and I'll see what I can do about it.

<p><li><b>How fast is JPython?</b>

    <P>At IPC-6 I reported that I had speed equal to CPython 1.4 on
    the pystone benchmark.  The current release doesn't include two of
    the optimizations that I use in my own version of the system so it
    will be about 15% slower than CPython 1.4.  These optimizations
    will be added back into the distribution when I have time to test
    them more carefully.  Finally, the 1.5 release of CPython is now
    available.  Guido has succeeded in making this release about 2x
    faster than the 1.4 release.  Therefore, JPython is currently
    about 2.5x slower than CPython 1.5.</P>

    <P>The speed of JPython is tied very tightly to the speed of the
    underlying JVM.  The benchmark results that I report are all using
    Microsoft's JVM from Internet Explorer 4.0.  The next fastest JVM
    that I have used is almost a factor of 2 slower than this.  At
    some point I'll want to collect a set of scores comparing PyStone
    performance on a wider variety of JVM's.</P>

    <P>Finally, pystone is not the last word in benchmarking.  At the
    moment I'm much more concerned with making JPython complete and
    correct than with performance.  After the 1.0 final release goes
    out (early 1998) I will revisit performance issues both to examine
    better benchmark's for comparing JPython and CPython (as well as
    other scripting languages for the JVM) and work at optimizing
    JPython's performance.

<p><li><b>Why did I get an OutOfMemoryError?</b>

    <P>If you are using SUN's Java VM (or a derived VM) the virtual
    machine sets a default memory limit of 16 MB.  This can be very
    confusing when you are running on a machine with 128 MB of RAM and
    you see an OutOfMemoryError after having used only 17 MB.</P>

    <P>You can increase this memory limit by adding the following
    switch to the call that invokes the Java VM (you need to modify
    the jpython launch script):</P>

<pre>
    <B>jre -mx32m &lt;...&gt;</B>
</pre>

    <P>This will set your upper memory limit to 32 MB.  Obviously,
    higher limits should be used if required by your program - and
    supported by your computer..

<p><li><b>Semantic Differences between JPython and CPython</b>

    <P>There are several several differences between JPython and
    CPython that wil probably never go away.  These differences are
    primarily related to underlying differences between the C and Java
    programming languages/environments.

<p><UL>
    <LI><em>JPython has true garbage collection - CPython uses
    reference counting</em>

    <br>This means that in JPython users don't need to worry about
	creating circular references as these are guarnteed to be
	collected properly.  On the other hand, users of JPython have
	no guarantees of when an object will be finalized (short of
	calling System.gc() to force garbage collection).
	Theoretically, this might cause problems for users who were
	depending on CPython's finalization timing to free limited
	system resources.

    <LI><em>Control-C can not be caught by JPython, but will exit the
    shell completely</em>
</UL>

<p><li><b>What Parts of Python-1.5.1 Are Missing in JPython-1.0?</b>

    <p><b>Core Features</b>

    <UL>
	<LI>It is not possible to reassign sys.stdin. This
	will not be fixed until JPython-1.1.

	<LI>Built-in exceptions are string-based and not class-based.
	This corresponds to Python-1.4.  JPython-1.1 will implement
	class-based exceptions for built-in exceptions.
    </UL>

    <p><b>Standard Modules</b>

    <UL>
	<li>Many of the standard modules are not implemented yet.
	Many of those that are implemented are incomplete and/or
	inefficient.  See <A HREF="#Supported Modules">What parts of
	the Python library are supported?</A> for more
	info.
    </UL>
