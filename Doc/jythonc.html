<H2>Compiling Python Source to Real Java Classes - jpythonc</H2>
<P>The previous section describes how Python classes can be created that subclass from Java classes.&nbsp; This
works very well when you want to pass a Python class into Java from JPython.&nbsp; This is not adequate for building
real Java &quot;.class&quot; files that implement a Java class and can be passed directly to Java programs.&nbsp;
This sort of functionality is required to build applets, servlets, or JavaBeans in JPython that can be used exactly
like their Java equivalents.&nbsp; It is also very valuable for users who wish to subclass Python classes in Java.</P>

<P>In order to build a real java class from a Python class, you will use the jpythonc tool.&nbsp; A script to access
jpythonc should have been installed in the JPython installation directory when you installed the package.&nbsp;
If it was not, it can be invoked as follows: &quot;jpython Tools\jpythonc\jpythonc.py&quot;.</P>

<P>This script accepts the following arguments:</P>

<P><B>jpythonc</B> [<B>-jar</B> jarfile] [<B>-cab</B> cabfile] [<B>-dir</B> directory] <I>[-main]<B> </B></I>[<B>-core</B>
| -<B>all</B>] [<B>-deep</B>] [<B>-lib</B> libraries] [-<B>skip</B> modules] [module]* <BR>
&nbsp; 
<TABLE BORDER="1">
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-jar</B> jarfile</TD>
		<TD>Specifies a .jar file to create and put the results of the freeze into.&nbsp; <BR>
			Not really useful for &quot;shallow&quot; freezes</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-cab</B> cabfile</TD>
		<TD>Specifies a .cab file to create and put the files into.&nbsp; <BR>
			This only works with Microsoft's JVM (.cab is a MS format)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-dir</B> directory</TD>
		<TD>Specifies that the files should be put into the given directory.&nbsp; <BR>
			If none of the first three options are specified, -dir '.' is assumed</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><I>-main</I></TD>
		<TD><I>Might be added to create a main method in generated class</I>&nbsp; <BR>
			<I>Will only be added if someone convinces me it's necessary</I></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-core</B></TD>
		<TD>Include the core JPython libraries (about 130K)&nbsp; <BR>
			Needed for applets since Netscape doesn't yet support multiple archives</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>-<B>all</B></TD>
		<TD>Include all of the JPython libraries (everything in core + compiler and parser)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-deep</B></TD>
		<TD>Compile both this one class and all dependencies.&nbsp; <BR>
			This is used for creating applets</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>-<B>bean </B>jarfile</TD>
		<TD>Creates a .jar file containing a bean&nbsp; <BR>
			The correct manifest file will be generated and included</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-lib</B> libraries</TD>
		<TD>Specifies a set of libraries (delimited by the platform's path separator character)&nbsp; <BR>
			Dependencies in these libraries will not be included in the result of the freeze&nbsp; <BR>
			This option only makes sense when combined with <B>-deep</B></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>-<B>skip </B>modules</TD>
		<TD>Specifies a comma-separated list of modules not to freeze, or include in archive</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD><B>-useproxy</B></TD>
		<TD><B>For Expert Users Only!</B>&nbsp; <BR>
			The generated proxy class will be a shell around the standard JPython proxy class&nbsp; <BR>
			You must have a cached copy of the appropriate proxy class to use this flag</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>module*</TD>
		<TD>A list of Python modules to freeze&nbsp; <BR>
			Can be either modules names that are on the python.path or .py files</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
The Python module must contain a Python class with the same name as the module, and that Python class must subclass
exactly one Java class or interface.&nbsp; The real Java class created will be a subclass of whatever Java class
is subclassed.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<P>On my Windows NT machine, I used the following command to create the file appletdemo.jar (containing all of
the applet demos on the web site, as well as the core JPython libraries):</P>
<PRE>c:\jpython\Demo\applet&gt; jpythonc -core -deep -jar appletdemo.jar *.py</PRE>
<P>To generate a skeleton class to allow a Python class to be used as java.awt.Component in a Java gui program,
I used the following command:</P>
<PRE>c:\jpython\Demo\javaclasses&gt; jpythonc Graph.py</PRE>
<P>To generate a JPython-based bean I do the following:</P>
<PRE>c:\jpython\Demo\bean&gt; jpythonc -deep -bean f2c.jar conversion.FahrenheitToCelsius</PRE>
<P>To use this with SUN's BDK, I do the following (the important steps are to make the bean and the JPython libraries
known to the tool).</P>
<P>1) modify BDK\beanbox\run.bat (or run.sh) to include the jpython\JavaCode in the CLASSPATH <BR>
2) copy f2c.jar to BDK\jars</P>

<P>You should now be able to access the FahrenheitToCelsius bean from SUN's BeanBox (or other Bean-aware tool).
