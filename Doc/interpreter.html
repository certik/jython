<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Invoking the JPython Interpreter</H2>
<P>JPython can be invoked from the shell using the following command:</P>

<P><B>jpython [-i] [-showjavaexc] [file | -] [arg]*</B></P>

<P><B>-i </B>: inspect interactively after running script</P>

<P>-<B>showjavaexc</B>: display the actual Java exception which was raised (useful for mixed Java/Python debugging)</P>

<P><B>-</B> : Treat stdin as a file.&nbsp; This flag allows you to use pipe file into jpython and have them treated
correctly.  This would be useful in a case like: &quot;filter file | jpython -&quot;.
<H3>Details</H3>
<P>&quot;jpython&quot; is a short script that invokes your local JVM, sets the java property &quot;install.path&quot;
to an appropriate value, and then runs the Java classfile &quot;org.python.core.jpython&quot;.</P>
<H3>Making JPython Scripts Executable</H3>
<P>To make a jpython &quot;.py&quot; file executable on a Unix system you can add the following line to the top
of the file:
<PRE><B>#! /usr/bin/env jpython</B></PRE>
<P>For this magic to work, you must have jpython somewhere on your standard PATH.  You also must also make the
&quot;.py&quot; file executable.  Typically this is done with the command: &quot;<TT>chmod +x foo.py</TT>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Note: &quot;#! &lt;...&gt;/jpython&quot; will probably not work to make your script executable.  This is because
&quot;jpython&quot; is itself a script, and the #! magic requires that the file to execute is a binary executable
on most Unix variants.  Using &quot;/usr/bin/env&quot; will get around this problem - and make your scripts more
portable in the bargain.</I>
