    Jim Hugunin invented JPython and was the primary developer while
    he was at CNRI.  In February 1999, Jim left CNRI for sunny
    California and Barry Warsaw became the primary maintainer.  Jim
    continues to provide valuable assistance, as does Python's
    inventor Guido van Rossum.

    You can contact the Jython maintainers directly via
    jython-dev@lists.sourceforge.net, or the Jython community at
    jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

    Finn Bock has been a frequent and valuable contributor to 
    Jython, and has provided bug fixes and these important modules:

        cPickle.java
        cStringIO.java
        struct.java
        binascii.java

    Harry Mantakos contributed the underlying md5 implementation.

    The SHA1 implementation is taken from cryptix.

    Samuele Pedroni has designed and implemented the improved 
    PackageManagers and java reload support and also fixed a lot 
    of bugs.

    Kevin Butler have written and contributed the code for os.environ and 
    os.system().
