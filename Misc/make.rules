# Sun's javac.  I have tested JPython with Jikes 0.47 on Solaris.  You 
# may need to change BOOTSTRAPCLASSES to point to your standard Java
# classes.  Jikes requires you to supply your own standard classes;
# the one described below comes from Sun's production JDK 1.2 for
# Solaris.

# JPython uses the OROMatcher regular expression library from ORO,
# Inc. to provide its Perl5 compatible regular expression support.  We
# cannot distribute OROMatcher as source or separate class files, so
# you will have to either download OROMatcher yourself, or disable
# regular expressions in JPython.

# OROMatcher is available from www.oroinc.com.  If you download it
# yourself, change the definition of OROMATCHERROOT to point to the
# directory where you installed it.
#
# If you do not have the OROMatcher regular expression library,
# read the comments in the file org/python/modules/Makefile.
