Welcome to Jython 2.2b2
=======================

This is the second beta release towards the 2.2 version of Jython. It
contains all of the new features for the 2.2 release:
 - new-style classes
 - Java List integration
 - a PEP 302 implementation
 - iterators
 - generators
 - __future__ division
 - support for running on modern JVMs
 - a new installer

In addition to these major features, many bugs have been fixed from 2.2b1.  See
the NEWS file for a more complete list of changes.

The release was compiled on Windows XP with JDK 6 but it should run on
1.4.2+.

This release exists to solicit feedback about any bugs or missing
features; if you can provide it, it is greatly appreciated.  Bug
reports can be created at http://jython.org/bugs whereas more general
questions can be sent to the Jython-dev mailing list,
jython-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.

The current plan calls for a release candiate in a few weeks, and if it proves
stable, the final release of 2.2 a few weeks after that.
