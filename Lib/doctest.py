"""Module doctest -- a framework for running examples in docstrings.

NORMAL USAGE

In normal use, end each module M with:

def _test():
    import doctest, M           # replace M with your module's name
    return doctest.testmod(M)   # ditto

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=1" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=0".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

In any case, testmod returns a 2-tuple of ints (f, t), where f is the
number of docstring examples that failed and t is the total number of
docstring examples attempted.


WHICH DOCSTRINGS ARE EXAMINED?

+ M.__doc__.

+ f.__doc__ for all functions f in M.__dict__.values(), except those
  defined in other modules.

+ C.__doc__ for all classes C in M.__dict__.values(), except those
  defined in other modules.

+ If M.__test__ exists and "is true", it must be a dict, and
  each entry maps a (string) name to a function object, class object, or
  string.  Function and class object docstrings found from M.__test__
  are searched even if the name is private, and strings are searched
  directly as if they were docstrings.  In output, a key K in M.__test__
  appears with name
      <name of M>.__test__.K

Any classes found are recursively searched similarly, to test docstrings in
their contained methods and nested classes.  All names reached from
M.__test__ are searched.

Optionally, functions with private names can be skipped (unless listed in
M.__test__) by supplying a function to the "isprivate" argument that will
identify private functions.  For convenience, one such function is
supplied.  docttest.is_private considers a name to be private if it begins
with an underscore (like "_my_func") but doesn't both begin and end with
(at least) two underscores (like "__init__").  By supplying this function
or your own "isprivate" function to testmod, the behavior can be customized.

If you want to test docstrings in objects with private names too, stuff
them into an M.__test__ dict, or see ADVANCED USAGE below (e.g., pass your
own isprivate function to Tester's constructor, or call the rundoc method
of a Tester instance).

WHAT'S THE EXECUTION CONTEXT?

By default, each time testmod finds a docstring to test, it uses a *copy*
of M's globals (so that running tests on a module doesn't change the
module's real globals, and so that one test in M can't leave behind crumbs
that accidentally allow another test to work).  This means examples can
freely use any names defined at top-level in M.  It also means that sloppy
imports (see above) can cause examples in external docstrings to use
globals inappropriate for them.

You can force use of your own dict as the execution context by passing
"globs=your_dict" to testmod instead.  Presumably this would be a copy of
M.__dict__ merged with the globals from other imported modules.


WHAT IF I WANT TO TEST A WHOLE PACKAGE?

Piece o' cake, provided the modules do their testing from docstrings.
Here's the test.py I use for the world's most elaborate Rational/
floating-base-conversion pkg (which I'll distribute some day):

from Rational import Cvt
from Rational import Format
from Rational import machprec
from Rational import Rat
from Rational import Round
from Rational import utils

modules = (Cvt,
           Format,
           machprec,
           Rat,
           Round,
           utils)

def _test():
    import doctest
    import sys
    verbose = "-v" in sys.argv
    for mod in modules:
        doctest.testmod(mod, verbose=verbose, report=0)
    doctest.master.summarize()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

IOW, it just runs testmod on all the pkg modules.  testmod remembers the
names and outcomes (# of failures, # of tries) for each item it's seen, and
passing "report=0" prevents it from printing a summary in verbose mode.
Instead, the summary is delayed until all modules have been tested, and
then "doctest.master.summarize()" forces the summary at the end.

So this is very nice in practice:  each module can be tested individually
with almost no work beyond writing up docstring examples, and collections
of modules can be tested too as a unit with no more work than the above.


WHAT ABOUT EXCEPTIONS?

No problem, as long as the only output generated by the example is the
traceback itself.  For example:

    >>> [1, 2, 3].remove(42)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
    >>>

Note that only the exception type and value are compared (specifically,
only the last line in the traceback).


ADVANCED USAGE

doctest.testmod() captures the testing policy I find most useful most
often.  You may want other policies.

testmod() actually creates a local instance of class doctest.Tester, runs
appropriate methods of that class, and merges the results into global
Tester instance doctest.master.

You can create your own instances of doctest.Tester, and so build your own
policies, or even run methods of doctest.master directly.  See
doctest.Tester.__doc__ for details.


SO WHAT DOES A DOCSTRING EXAMPLE LOOK LIKE ALREADY!?

Oh ya.  It's easy!  In most cases a copy-and-paste of an interactive
console session works fine -- just make sure the leading whitespace is
rigidly consistent (you can mix tabs and spaces if you're too lazy to do it
right, but doctest is not in the business of guessing what you think a tab
means).

    >>> # comments are ignored
    >>> x = 12
    >>> x
    12
    >>> if x == 13:
    ...     print "yes"
    ... else:
    ...     print "no"
    ...     print "NO"
    ...     print "NO!!!"
    ...
    no
    NO
    NO!!!
    >>>

Any expected output must immediately follow the final ">>>" or "..." line
containing the code, and the expected output (if any) extends to the next
">>>" or all-whitespace line.  That's it.

Bummers:

+ Expected output cannot contain an all-whitespace line, since such a line
  is taken to signal the end of expected output.

+ Output to stdout is captured, but not output to stderr (exception
  tracebacks are captured via a different means).

+ If you continue a line via backslashing in an interactive session, or for
  any other reason use a backslash, you need to double the backslash in the
  docstring version.  This is simply because you're in a string, and so the
  backslash must be escaped for it to survive intact.  Like:

>>> if "yes" == \\
...     "y" +   \\
...     "es":   # in the source code you'll see the doubled backslashes
...     print 'yes'
yes

The starting column doesn't matter:

>>> assert "Easy!"
     >>> import math
            >>> math.floor(1.9)
            1.0

and as many leading whitespace characters are stripped from the expected
output as appeared in the initial ">>>" line that triggered it.

If you execute this very file, the examples above will be found and
executed, leading to this output in verbose mode:

Running doctest.__doc__
Trying: [1, 2, 3].remove(42)
Expecting:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
ok
Trying: x = 12
Expecting: nothing
ok
Trying: x
Expecting: 12
ok
Trying:
if x == 13:
    print "yes"
else:
    print "no"
    print "NO"
    print "NO!!!"
Expecting:
no
NO
NO!!!
ok
... and a bunch more like that, with this summary at the end:

Optional keyword arg "mod" is a module, whose globals are used for
executing examples.  If not specified, globs must be specified.

Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
when executing examples; if not specified, use the globals from
module mod.

In either case, a copy of the dict is used for each docstring
examined.

Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, only
failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

Optional keyword arg "isprivate" specifies a function used to determine
whether a name is private.  The default function is to assume that
no functions are private.  The "isprivate" arg may be set to
doctest.is_private in order to skip over functions marked as private
using an underscore naming convention; see its docs for details.

    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  This is new in 2.3.  Possible values:

        DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1
            By default, if an expected output block contains just "1",
            an actual output block containing just "True" is considered
            to be a match, and similarly for "0" versus "False".  When
            DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1 is specified, neither substitution
            is allowed.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay
    displaying a summary.  Invoke doctest.master.summarize(verbose)
    when you're done fiddling.
