This directory contains the support files for the LiftOff installer.

   http://liftoff.sourceforge.net

The liftoff software must be installed. At least version 0.3 must be used.
At the time of writing version 0.3 is not released, but is avilable in the 
liftoff CVS.

Liftoff is started with a command line like this:


   java -Ddatadir=<liftoff-path>/data -cp <liftoff-path>/lib/LiftOff.jar \
                              net.sourceforge.liftoff.builder.Main




liftoff.props    The project file for liftoff. In the liftoff builder open
                 this file with the File/Open menu.


liftoff.filelist A list of files to include in the installer. This file is 
                 referenced from the liftoff.props file. It is generated by
                 the mklist.py script.

mklist.py        A script which traverse the jython directories and creates
                 (on stdout) a liftoff.filelist. This script must be run 
                 whenever files are added or removed from jython.

jython.gif       The side-image used by the generated installer.

                 These files are referenced from the the liftoff.props 
                 file.
